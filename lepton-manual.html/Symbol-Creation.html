<span id="Overview-2"></span><h4 class="subsection">4.1.1 Overview</h4>

<p>This document describes the creation of component symbols, including
style conventions, and hints/tips and things to look out for when
drawing symbols for the gEDA/gaf system.
</p>

<span id="Component-Symbol-Creation"></span><h4 class="subsection">4.1.2 Component Symbol Creation</h4>

<p>Component symbols (from here on known as <em>symbols</em>) are drawn
using <code>lepton-schematic</code>.  You can start with a blank page or a known-to-be
good symbol that is similar to the one you want to create.
</p>

<span id="Preparing"></span><h4 class="subsubsection">4.1.2.1 Preparing</h4>

<p>Before you open <code>lepton-schematic</code> to create your symbol, there are a few
questions you should ask yourself, that will effect how you create
your symbol:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Is this symbol purely for aesthetic purposes (a graphic)?  If so,
several steps are simplified.

</li><li> Do I want to simulate the component in question, with e.g. SPICE?

</li><li> Do I want to use this symbol in a schematic that includes power
distribution?  This will become important when deciding what pins to
draw.

</li><li> Does this symbol represent a component that comes several in a
package?  This is called <em>slotting</em> in gEDA&rsquo;s language, and has
special rules.

</li></ol>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve answered those questions, the following guide will be more
useful to you.
</p>
<p>To start building your symbol:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Open <code>lepton-schematic</code>.

</li><li> The default empty page has boxes on it.  Use the selection tool (the
one that looks like a black mouse cursor) to select everything on the
page.  Hit the <kbd>Delete</kbd> key to delete it.

</li><li> Zoom in at least one step (View &rarr; Zoom, or hit
the <kbd>Z</kbd> key).

</li><li> Make sure the snap-to-grid functionality is ON (Options
&rarr; Toggle Snap On/Off, or <kbd>O S</kbd>).

</li><li> Make sure grid snap size is set to 100 (Options
&rarr; Snap Grid Spacing..., or <kbd>O Shift-S</kbd>).

</li></ol>


<span id="Drawing-your-Symbol"></span><h4 class="subsubsection">4.1.2.2 Drawing your Symbol</h4>

<p>Use the &lsquo;<samp>line</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>box</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>circle</samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp>arc</samp>&rsquo; tools
(in the &lsquo;<samp>Add</samp>&rsquo; menu) to create a simplified visual representation
of your device.  Make sure that the only color you use is
<code>graphic</code> (green).  Do not place any pins on the device until the
next step.
</p>
<p>To check what color you are using to draw, go to Edit
&rarr; Color... (or hit <kbd>E O</kbd>).
</p>

<span id="Placing-Pins-on-your-Symbol"></span><h4 class="subsubsection">4.1.2.3 Placing Pins on your Symbol</h4>

<p>If you have decided your symbol is graphical in nature (e.g., does not
connect to anything, is just artwork), you can skip this step.
</p>
<p>Add your first pin.
</p><ol>
<li> Select Add &rarr; Pin, or hit <kbd>A P</kbd>.  Once that
is done, click from the end of your pin, to one of the edges of your
symbol.  A &rsquo;0&rsquo; and the word &rsquo;unknown&rsquo; should pop up near your new pin.
Please note that the direction you draw your pins is important.  If
you draw them starting from the edge of your symbol to outside of your
symbol, you will end up with text outside of the symbol!

</li><li> Click on the selection tool, and use it to select the pin you just
drew.  The pin and text with it should change colors, and boxes should
be drawn around the ends of the pin.

</li><li> Select Edit &rarr; Edit..., or hit <kbd>E E</kbd> (or
right click, and hit &lsquo;<samp>Edit...</samp>&rsquo;).  This will bring up the edit
dialog for this pin.

</li></ol>

<p>In the Edit dialog for a pin, you should see four attributes
(<var>name=value</var> pairs) already associated with your new pin.  These
attributes can be edited by clicking on the attribute in the list at
the top of the edit window, then clicking on the field you want to
edit.  Note that when selected, the &lsquo;<samp>Add Attribute</samp>&rsquo; section of
this dialog does not reflect what has been selected, as it is only
meant for addition, not for editing.
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at each attribute already associated with your pin, and
edit some of the values.  I recommend expanding the size of the edit
window until all attributes are visible.
</p><ul>
<li> All pins should have a <var>pinseq</var> attribute.  This number dictates
the order pins are looked at on this symbol in SPICE, <code>lepton-netlist</code>, and
other tools.  For our first pin, start this sequence number at
<code>1</code>, incrementing it on each new pin, as we add them.

</li><li> All pins should have a <var>pinnumber</var> attribute.  This is the number
of the pin, on the package of the item you are drawing a symbol for.
<var>pinnumber</var> values can be alphanumeric (i.e. like <code>E</code> or
<code>C</code>).

</li><li> All pins should have a <var>pinlabel</var> attribute.  This attribute is
the name or label of the pin (not the pin number).

</li><li> All pins should have a <var>pintype</var> attribute.  This attribute
describes the kind of a pin.

</li><li> <var>pinseq</var> and <var>pinnumber</var> attributes of several pins can be
automatically numbered by Attributes &rarr;
Autonumber Text....

</li></ul>

<p>Possible <var>pintype</var> values are: <var>in</var>, <var>out</var>, <var>io</var>,
<var>oc</var>, <var>oe</var>, <var>pas</var>, <var>tp</var>, <var>tri</var>, <var>clk</var>,
<var>pwr</var>.  See <a href="pintype-attribute.html">pintype attribute</a> for more info.
