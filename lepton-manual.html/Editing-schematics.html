<p>In order to do any action on some object, you have to select it first.
See <a href="Selecting-objects.html">Selecting objects</a> if you don&rsquo;t know how to do it.
</p>
<p>When editing schematics, you can undo and redo several last actions
using Edit &rarr; Undo (<kbd>Ctrl-Z</kbd>, <kbd>U</kbd>,
<kbd>Shift-U</kbd>, or <kbd>E Shift-U</kbd>) and Edit &rarr;
Redo (<kbd>Shift-Ctrl-Z</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl-Y</kbd>, <kbd>Shift-R</kbd>, or <kbd>E
Shift-R</kbd>).  The latter restores the results of the last editing action
undone with Edit &rarr; Undo.  The number of
possible actions for undo/redo is limited in the configuration setting
<a href="schematic_002eundo-group.html#undo_002dlevels">undo-levels</a>.
</p>
<p>If you need to copy some objects, select them and do
Edit &rarr; Copy Mode (<kbd>C</kbd> or <kbd>E C</kbd>).  The
objects will be visually duplicated and you will be able to put the
copies where you need to by left-clicking on the canvas.  This allows
one-time copy of the objects.  Another option is copying objects
multiple times.  Select Edit &rarr; Multiple Copy
Mode or hit <kbd>E Y</kbd> to switch on the mode.  Use left-click to
insert the objects.  Unlike the former case, copying won&rsquo;t stop after
first insertion.  Click once again, and a new copy will be made.  The
copying process can be stopped by switching to some other mode, for
example, by hitting <kbd>Esc</kbd> to choose the select mode, or by
clicking at the net mode button in the toolbar.  In both cases (one or
multiple copies), the current selection does not change during the
process.
</p>
<p>The objects on canvas can also be copied or cut to clipboard, and
pasted from it using Edit &rarr; Copy
(<kbd>Ctrl-C</kbd>), Edit &rarr; Cut (<kbd>Ctrl-X</kbd>),
Edit &rarr; Paste (<kbd>Ctrl-V</kbd>) correspondingly.
To delete all currently selected objects use Edit
&rarr; Delete (<kbd>Delete</kbd>, <kbd>D</kbd>, or <kbd>E D</kbd>).  If some of the
objects are locked, the dialog prompting for deletion of all selected
objects or only unlocked ones will appear, in which you can also
cancel the deletion.
</p>
<p>You can move objects on the canvas using the left mouse button: click
on the object you want to move, keep the button depressed, drag the
object where you need to and release the button to place the object.
The object gets selected after the operation.  If you select several
objects beforehand, the same operation allows you to move and place
them all.  Sometimes it is more convenient to switch on move mode to
move objects without depressing the mouse button.  Select
Edit &rarr; Move Mode (<kbd>M</kbd> or <kbd>E M</kbd>) and
move the selected objects where you want to, then use left click once
to place them on the canvas.
</p>
<p>Edit &rarr; Rotate 90 Mode (<kbd>E R</kbd>) rotates
selected objects by 90 degrees counter-clockwise each time.  The
objects are rotated around the mouse cursor.
</p>
<p>Edit &rarr; Mirror mode (<kbd>E I</kbd>) can be used to
mirror objects such as components and pictures around the X axis.
Mirroring of other, simple objects is supported as well, though it&rsquo;s
rarely useful.  Mirroring around the Y axis is not yet supported.
However, you can use a sequence of mirrorings and rotations as a
workaround to get the look you want.
</p>
<p>You can also rotate or mirror objects while moving them, using one of
the ways described above, or when inserting a component.
</p>
<p>Edit &rarr; Object Properties... (<kbd>E O</kbd>) opens a
dialog where you can see and change the properties of primitives such
as lines, boxes, pins, text and so on.  The editable properties
include color, stroke and filling styles, and the type of pins.
Changing of a property affects all objects selected if they support
it.
</p>
<p>If <a href="schematic_002egui-group.html#use_002ddocks">docks</a> are enabled in your configuration, the
properties widget will be shown as the first tab in the right dock.
</p>
<p>Edit &rarr; Rotate 90 Mode (<kbd>E R</kbd>) rotates
selected objects by 90 degrees counter-clockwise each time.  The
objects are rotated around the mouse cursor.
</p>
<p>You can also rotate or mirror objects while moving them, using one of
the ways described above, or when inserting a component.
</p>
<p>Apart from editing properties of primitive objects for which the
<em>Object Properties...</em> dialog described above is used, you can
edit text contents of text objects such as plain text and attributes.
Use Edit &rarr; Edit... (<kbd>E E</kbd>) to start editing
text objects.  Depending on what objects are selected, one of the
following dialogs will be opened.  <em>Edit Attributes</em> dialog is
opened for connectible objects which include components, pins, nets,
and buses.  For non-connectible graphical primitives such as lines,
boxes, etc. the action does nothing.  For plain attributes, the
command opens the <em>Edit Attribute</em> dialog (please note the
singular <em>Attribute</em> instead of plural <em>Attributes</em> in the
former case).  In the dialog you can select and change attribute
names, values, and visibility.  For plain text objects, the command
opens the <em>Edit Text</em> dialog the same way as if you would use by
Edit &rarr; Edit Text....  If selected objects
include a mixed set of plain text objects, attributes, and connectible
objects, the program opens the dialog appropriate for the objects
selected first so you may end up with not what you really wanted.  In
such a case, deselect objects, select wanted ones, and try again.
</p>
<p>The action Edit &rarr; Edit Text... (<kbd>E X</kbd>) and
the <em>Edit Text</em> dialog box it invokes is intended for editing
plain text objects.  Thus, unlike the attribute editing dialogs, this
dialog displays attributes as strings in the form &ldquo;name=value&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>If <a href="schematic_002egui-group.html#use_002ddocks">docks</a> are enabled in your configuration, the
<em>Edit Text</em> widget will be shown as the second tab in the right
dock.
</p>
<p>Sometimes a symbol may represent components with different pin numbers
without changing it in any other aspect.  For example, quad-opamp has
four same opamps in one package for which only pin numbers differ on
schematic page.  Such components are called <em>slotted</em> and there
is a special action in <code>lepton-schematic</code> to change the slot number quickly.
Use Edit &rarr; Slot... (<kbd>E Shift-S</kbd>) and enter
the slot number you want.  It should be greater than zero but not
greater than the value stored in the &ldquo;numslot&rdquo; attribute of the
symbol.  While you can attach the &ldquo;slot&rdquo; attribute to any object on
the page, slots are useless for graphical primitives, text, and
pictures, and are only meaningful for such slotted components.  While
you can use the attribute for non-slotted components, it won&rsquo;t add
much to your schematics unless you change the component symbol to
support slots by adding both &ldquo;numslots&rdquo; attribute and &ldquo;slotdef&rdquo;
attributes which determine how many slots will be used at all and what
pin numbers will be used for each particular slot.
</p>
<p>Sometimes you want some objects on the page to not get in your way
while editing schematics.  It is particularly true for big symbols
like title blocks (see <a href="Title-block-symbol.html">Title block symbol</a>).  Such symbols are
intentionally put to background and other symbols are placed over
them.  The issue here is the selection mechanism of <code>lepton-schematic</code>.
When you click on an object to select it, and there are several
selectable objects under the mouse cursor, the program will select
each of them one by one to let you choose the wanted one.  Locked
symbols are to be excluded from such a sequence since it would be
annoying to, say, every time select the title block symbol when you
merely want to select any other object within it.  Select symbols you
want to be locked and use Edit &rarr; Lock (<kbd>E
L</kbd>) to lock them.  (By the way, you rarely need this for title blocks
as they usually are added as already locked when a new schematic is
created.  See <a href="Title-block-symbol.html">Title block symbol</a> for more information.)  In order
to unlock a symbol, select it using box selection (see <a href="Box-selection.html">Box selection</a>) and use Edit &rarr; Unlock (<kbd>E
Shift-L</kbd>).
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Note:</b> Locking and unlocking actions affect not only components but also all
the attributes attached to them.  You don&rsquo;t have to select each one of
them individually, it is sufficient to select just the component they
are attached to.
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Note:</b> Primitive objects (not components) cannot be locked or unlocked, it is
not supported in the current file format (see <a href="gEDA-file-format.html">gEDA file format</a>).
However, a Scheme extension may be used in Lepton to achieve that.
</p></blockquote>

<p>There are two special actions that allow you to save data of a
component or a picture within schematic or undo such a change.
Edit &rarr; Embed Component/Picture (<kbd>E B</kbd>)
embeds the data of selected component or picture into schematic.  This
may make sense in case you want to distribute your schematic as one
file and/or prevent data loss or corruption due to different set of
symbols available at the target and destination locations.  Currently,
you have to embed each component or picture instance if you have
several of them in your schematic.  Otherwise, not embedded objects
won&rsquo;t be present in the schematic if you don&rsquo;t include libraries with
appropriate symbols into your project.  This is limitation of the
current file format.  See <a href="gEDA-file-format.html">gEDA file format</a> for more information.
Embedding objects makes thus the file size bigger (sometimes, much
bigger), and after you made sure anything is OK, and necessary symbols
or pictures are in place, you may want to unembed the objects.  The
action Edit &rarr; Unembed Component/Picture (<kbd>E
Shift-B</kbd>) does just that.  It unembeds a component or picture embedded
by the menu item action described above.  Note that the command will
be ignored if you don&rsquo;t have the symbol or image corresponding to your
unembeddable object in one of the libraries available for your
schematic.  Remember to open the log window and see what could went
wrong if your schematic file did not change after this action and
saving it.
</p>
<p>If you edit a symbol and save it, schematics containing it are not
updated automatically.  You have to update component instances
manually.  Select the components you want to update and use
Edit &rarr; Update Component (<kbd>E U</kbd>) to actually
do it.
</p>
<p>Another useful action is translation of the page contents to origin,
that is, to the coordinate (0, 0) of the page.  It is usually
necessary when you create or edit a symbol.  The origin defines the
anchor of the symbol.  When you insert the symbol from the component
library, this point in the symbol corresponds to the position of the
mouse cursor, so the visible contents of your component will be
positioned around the mouse cursor at the same distance the contents
of the corresponding symbol is positioned around the origin within it.
Usually, it is the left-bottom point of a symbol.  However you can
define it anywhere. If you want, for example, the anchor to be located
at the center of your symbol, move the symbol contents to lay around
the origin.  Use Edit &rarr; Symbol Translate...
(<kbd>E T</kbd>) to translate the symbol you edit to origin and then place
its contents the way you wish.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Note:</b> If the contents of your symbol is too far from origin, you may even
not see the symbol when inserting.  Zoom out to see if this is the
case then.
